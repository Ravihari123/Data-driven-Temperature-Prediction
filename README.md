# Deep-Learning-Project
This study focuses on developing a data-driven temperature prediction model for permanent magnet synchronous motors using several machine learning models. The Ordinary Least Square Method, K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) were trained as the models to perform time-series regression analysis, and the performances of these models were evaluated against the Goodness of Fit (R2), Mean Squared Error(MSE) and Mean Absolute Error values. These models were trained to predict four temperature parameters of PMSMs; the temperature of magnet surface, statorâ€™s yoke, tooth, and winding based on the values of motor speed, ambient, torque, direct-axis current, quadrature-axis current, direct-axis voltage, quadrature-axis voltage, and coolant temperature.
